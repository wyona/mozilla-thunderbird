<h2>Specification: Mozilla/Thunderbird extension for saving emails and attachments to a CMS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
One often receives email messages with attachments, which relate to company projects or
other topics. In order to make this content accessible to other people involved and
also to keep a record and being able to search with a specific full-text search engine, one
wants to file the messages and attachments into a content management system.
At the moment one can download the messages and attachments to the local desktop and
then "upload" this content to the content management system, but which is often very
cumbersome and often forgotten.
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem we want to extend Mozilla/Thunderbird that one can directly file from
within the UI of the email client the messages and attachments into the Content Management System.

<h3>Saving/Moving/Copying an email message</h3>
<p>
Right click on an email message opens the context menu. Clicking on the menu items "Move To"
or "Copy To" opens a submenu. This submenu should be extended by an additional submenu item
"Remote Folders".
