<h2>Specification: Mozilla/Thunderbird extension for saving emails and attachments to a CMS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
One often receives email messages with attachments, which relate to company projects or
other topics. In order to make this content accessible to other people involved and
also to keep a record and being able to search with a specific full-text search engine, one
wants to file the messages and attachments into a content management system.
At the moment one can download the messages and attachments to the local desktop and
then "upload" this content to the content management system, but which is often very
cumbersome and often forgotten.
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem we want to extend Mozilla/Thunderbird that one can directly file from
within the UI of the email client the messages and attachments into the Content Management System.
</p>

<p>
This specification could be considered as part of OSR-101
</p>

<h3>Configuring the server(s) (CMS) within the email client (Mozilla/Thunderbird)</h3>
<p>
Clicking on the email account one receives a screen with a list of functionalities (Mozilla Mail).
One should extend this list by adding an item "Configure Remote Servers" as a subitem of
Advanced Features.
</p>

<h3>Saving/Moving/Copying an email message</h3>
<p>
Right click on an email message opens the context menu. Clicking on the menu items "Move To"
or "Copy To" opens a submenu. This submenu should be extended by an additional submenu item
"Remote Folders". TBD: Where shall these remote folders be configured???
</p>

<h3>Saving/Moving/Copying an attachment</h3>
<p>
Right click on an attachment opens the context menu. This menu should be extended by an additional menu item "Save to remote folder". Clicking on this new menu item should open a "Save Attachment Dialog to remote folder" which is similar to the existing dialog ("Save As ..."), but the folder information is being retrieved through XML/WebDAV from the remote server and also the remote server should be selectable (see <a href="#configure-remote-server">Configuration of remote server</a>).
