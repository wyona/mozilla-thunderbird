 * cmsconnector.js:
    - add "Upload to CMS..." menu entry to File --> Attachments
      attachment sub menu.
    - add "Upload All to CMS..." menu entry to File --> Attachments
      menu.
    - factor out the checking of all attachments for elegibility loop.
    - disable "Upload All to CMS..." if all attachments are
      deleted/detached.
    - what happens if multiple attachments are selected (cmd-click)
    - check what happens if all attachments of a given message are
      deleted (neither "Upload to CMS..." NOR "Upload All to CMS..."
      should be enabled). Compare with built-in "Save All". -> TB
      crashes. Clearly, something we do not want to do with out
      extension menu item!
    * what happens to external attachments?
    - cmsconnector.js: disable "Upload to CMS..." in context menu if
      no attachment is selected (but not "Upload All to CMS..."!)

 * common.js:
    - make exceptions inherit from built-in object Error.

 * nodeselector.xul:
    - remove ok/cancel buttons and rely solely on intrinsic dialog
      buttons
    * persist previous node selection.
    - enquire about the generality of platform specific file pickers
      (i.e. if it is possible to change the back-end and reuse the
      native front-end). See
      http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL_Tutorial:Open_and_Save_Dialogs.
    - refactor suite file dialog.

 * options.xul:
    - add default "Add CMS first..." string to CMS menulist and
      disable it in order to render menulist widget correctly on gtk.
    - use same scheme as in TB preferences dialog for grouping instead
      of <groupbox>.

 * options-addcms.js:
    * enter full path to introspection URL.
    * if no file specified, add standard path.

 * options.js:
    * implement preferences infrastructure.

 * osr-101.js:
    * push completion of specification.
    * implement specification.
    * refactor stable implementation as a JavaScript XPCOM component.
       * generate idl files.

 * progressreporter.xul:
    * refactor FF download progress dialog.

 * install.rdf:
    * branding.

 * all files:
    * add tooltips
    * add "tabindex" attributes.
    * add "accesskey" attributes.
    * add copyright notice (javadoc- or GPL-style?).

 * testing:
    * test with Mozilla Suite 1.7.*.
    * test with Mozilla SeaMonkey 1.0.*.
