 * cmsconnector.js:
    * disable "Upload All to CMS..." if all attachments are deleted/detached.
    * what happens if multiple attachments are selected (cmd-click)
    - check what happens if all attachments of a given message are deleted (neither "Upload to CMS..." NOR "Upload All to CMS..." should be enabled). Compare with built-in "Save All". -> TB crashes. Clearly, something we do not want to do with out extension menu item!
    * what happens to external attachments?
    - cmsconnector.js: disable "Upload to CMS..." in context menu if no attachment is selected (but not "Upload All to CMS..."!)

 * common.js:
    - make exceptions inherit from built-in object Error.

 * nodeselector.xul:
    * Note: nodeselector.xul is currently broken due to filepicker.xul import!
    * refactor suite file dialog.
    * space below "Cancel" and "Upload" buttons must not flex.

 * osr-101.js:
    * push completion of specification.
    * implement specification.
    * refactor stable implementation as a JavaScript XPCOM component.
       * generate idl files.

 * progressreporter.xul:
    * refactor FF download progress dialog.

 * all files:
    * add copyright notice (javadoc- or GPL-style?).
