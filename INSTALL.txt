INSTALL
=======

1. Developers:
--------------

During development, you can simply create a file named

"cmsconnector@wyona.com"

within the existing Thunderbird/SeaMonkey profile extension directory, e.g.

"/home/wyona/.thunderbird/xm3kt8bg.default/extensions"

with the directory path to the source of the extension as content, e.g.

/home/wyona/src/wyona/public/mozilla-thunderbird/trunk/src

NOTE: There is a sample "cmsconnector@wyona.com" file included in
"public/mozilla-thunderbird/trunk/install/extensions" of your svn
checkout.



After having created the "cmsconnector@wyona.com" file, restart
Thunderbird/SeaMonkey.

NOTE: You might have to delete old "extensions.cache" and
"extensions.ini" files lying around in your profile first, e.g. within

/home/wyona/.thunderbird/xm3kt8bg.default

Otherwise, Mozilla may not notice the extension.

NOTE: If you have changed the extension's "install.rdf" file within the source, you
need to "touch" the directory indicated in the
"cmsconnector@wyona.com" file, in order to update its timestamp.

TEST: After having started Thunderbird/SeaMonkey, select the Tools -->
Extensions menu item. The CMSConnector should be listed in the opened
dialog, alongside your other installed extensions.


2. Deployers:
-------------

To deploy CMSConnector, create an XPI package starting from the
package containing the install.rdf. You can then upload it to your
central server, and distribute the URL of the package. This URL can
then be used together with the Thunderbird/SeaMonkey Extension Manager
to automatically install and update the package.
